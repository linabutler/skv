# Sync

* Three-table system: mirror, incoming staging area, outgoing staging area.
* Ideas for conflict resolution.
  - Let the caller specify its own merge function? `merge(ancestor, local, remote) -> newValue`
  - Default to comparing the relative ages of the incoming and outgoing changes (clock skew is an issue), and picking the newest.
    * iCloud Keychain and `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore` don't try to compare clocks, and default to "remote always wins".
  - Prior art: [schema-driven conflict resolution](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/blob/92f07367975ad5921315870504b68ea082890d30/docs/design/remerge/rfc.md), using [explicitly-declared relationships](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/modeling_data/configuring_relationships) to resolve conflicts, automatic three-way merging for each field.
    * Valid merges can produce semantically weird results (the "first name, last name, full name" problem from Firefox address autofill).
